# Project Three

**<span style="color:darkblue">Build a complex full stack application </span>**

## Outline

The period dedicated to projects in-class begins the afternoon of Thursday, May 21. **On the morning of Friday, May 29, we will be doing presentations to show the progress we have made**.

The upcoming weekend is a holiday weekend, and we **DO NOT** intend for you to be working during that time. Use Thursday and Friday to plan and solidify your ideas. Use the long weekend to get rested and re-engergized. Then come in next week and start building.

The dedicated project period is known as a ***sprint***. The purpose of the sprint is to fulfill a set of required features known as an ***MVP***, or *minimum viable product*.

During the sprint, each group will be assigned an instructor. Each day the group will have one meeting with their instructor to discuss their progress.

**The end of the sprint is not the end of the project**. The resulting application will be your first possible portfolio piece, and as such it would behoove us to continue to work on it in the months to come.

**Each group will be responsible for their own project**. This means that every student in the group must be able to explain what every piece of code does. Do not include code which you do not understand!

## Objectives

- Collaborate with your peers as a team
- Pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
- Gain experience collaborating and working in a development team.
- Practice integrating topics covered during this course thus far.
- Use [GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles) and [Trello](https://trello.com/) to collaborate


## Core Requirements
- __Application__
    - A server-side component built using Ruby on Rails and Postgres.
    - All of your routes should follow REST protocol
    - Consider using an external API to add to your Application
      - Resources to research API's:
        - [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/)
        - [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/)
- __Deployment__
  - Your application should be hosted on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
    - We will speak more about deployment to Heroku next week, but feel free to check out the documentation in the meantime if you're curious.
  - When presentation time comes around, you will be demo'ing the hosted version from one of our computers.
- __Group__
  - Teamwork will be key to this project and we want every team member to be involved.
  - Consider using pair programming when writing your code. It is great to ensure that you are writing good code and to help each team member understand the code base as it is being written.
    - There is a great Wikipedia [entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) on the subject. Be sure to pay attention to the `Benefits` section.
- __Indidivual__
    - Communicate.
    - Comment your code.

## Deliverables (Due on Friday, May 29th)

- The MVP of an application with a detailed README that features:
    - A short description of your application
    - Team members
    - Technologies used
    - A link to your Trello board
    - Artifacts
      - Wireframes
      - ERDs
- A [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations) that includes each member of your team.
- A new [Trello board](https://trello.com/) that serves as a prioritized list of tasks your team needs to complete during your sprint. This includes user stories, bug fix, general todo.
- Lightning talk that:
    - Demo your application on Heroku.
    - Each group will be presenting this talk to the entire class

##Final thoughts

**This is not a hack fest!** Cobbling or hacking together a bunch of code is not the point of this project. We want to write well structured, easy to read, and working code.

To this end, make sure you spend enough time planning your application and how you are going to implement it.
