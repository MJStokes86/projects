# Project Four

## Objective

To build a web-based application, at an individually appropriate level of challenge, that expresses your interests and capabilities as a developer.

## Parameters

Start: Tuesday June 2 @ 1:30pm

End: Tuesday June 9 @ 9:30am

Group Size: Individual or paired

## Instructor 1:1s

Each student will have one instructor that is assigned to helping them throughout the project.

At the start of your project please add your assigned instructor as a collaborator on your GitHub repo and your Trello.

We will field all requests for project help via GitHub issues. So, whenever you encounter a difficulty that you cannot solve, please follow the following procedure to obtain help.

#### Issue Requirements

We will look for the following in your issue description:

1. What User Story are you working on? (with a link to the card in your trello)
* If you are encountering a technical difficulty:
  * What error are you getting?
  * What have you attempted to fix your error?
  * A link to a line number in your application code where you think the error is occurring.
* If it is a conceptual or architectural issue:
  * Describe the conundrum
  * Explain the possible paths you have explored

Make sure **your instructor is added** to your project as a collaborator AND that you **assign them** to an issue after creating it. If you don't do this we will have no idea that you have a problem :(

*Please note* this is not like the queue system during TA hours:

First, we will ask you to re-write your issue if it does not meet the above requirements.

Second, we will do our best to answer you (either in person or online), but it may take us some time to get to your question so if you are truly 'stuck' you should find a way to put that story on hold and work on another feature.

## Criteria

Here is what we will be looking for as you build your application. Your assigned instructor will give you feedback on the points below:

1. **Process & Planning**
  * User Stories [1 - 5]:
    * Written in the proper format, ROLE GOAL REASON
    * Clearly deliver value to the end user
  * ERD [Y/N]: uses an ERD to think through the app's data needs
  * Disciplined Workflow [1 - 5]:
    * Uses Trello to manage workflow
    * Works on one story or chore at a time
    * Technical details solved 'just in time' - creates wireframes and technical specifications right before starting work on a story rather than at the beginning of the project
    * Properly documents issues via Github
2. **Product**
  * Github Repo [Y/N]:
    * Contains application code
    * A README that documents technologies used, wireframes, ERD, link to the deployed version, and a brief description of the project
  * Technical Choices [1 - 5]: tech choices are appropriate to the project aims
  * Code Hygiene [1 - 5]: code is properly indented and commented
  * Code Quality [1 - 5]:
    * variables, methods, classes are semantically named
    * blocks of code are small and readable - each block has one responsibility
